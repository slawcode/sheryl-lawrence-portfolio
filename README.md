Web Developer Portfolio

## Description

- The motivation for this project was to begin a portfolio to showcase my web development skills, which can be built upon as those skills improve and expand. 
- In the future, I hope to use this portfolio to help me in my job search when applying to positions. I also hope that this portfolio can be used as a tool to help me stand out having multiple deployed applications.
- I hope to vastly improve this portfolio in the future, especially the CSS page overall, but also a tidier HTML page, and add many more deployed applications with increasingly complex coding.
- There were many challenges in the process of creating this portfolio. Most of them occurred when adding CSS values. As one value was added it would effect another causing a change in the structure and the webpage visually. 
- Aligning the text properaly on the webpage was also a big challenge with this project, especially the main content. 
- Another challenge was maintaining the navigation links at the top of the portfolio page. At times, one or two were not working but by the end of the project, unfortunately, none were working.
- Through the making of this portfolio I pseudo-elements. 
- On a final note, I learned the importance of practice and how, with consistency, I can continue to improve my understanding and implementation of web development.
